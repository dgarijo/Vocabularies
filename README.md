# Vocabularies
Repository for storing all the different vocabularies and ontologies I have contributed to.

The exceptions are :
* PROV (http://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/) , which is stored in the W3C archive.
* The Video Game Ontology, stored in GitHub: https://github.com/dgarijo/VideoGameOntology
* The OntoSOft Ontology, stored in Github: https://github.com/ontosoft-earthcube/ontosoft
